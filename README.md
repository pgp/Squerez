A torrent download app for Android, based on Vuze

## Disclaimer
This is only for personal experimentation, the app has all the basic features offered by the command-line version of [Vuze](https://www.vuze.com), via a library repack you can find [here](https://github.com/pgp/Abvuze), but the battery usage is very high.
